# Modern Magic Theory

## What is this project

Modern Magic Theory is aimed to provide systemized, theorized, and general propuslized magic concept explanation by modern science and scientific fiction.

## Why make this project

1. It seems that no one is currently trying to explain what is magic through modern science or scientific fiction.
2. It is fun.
3. ~~It sounds more reasonable when someone trying to argue a character is more powerful.~~
4. ~~Get familiar with GitHub~~

## Why written on GitHub?
1. Easy back tracking.
2. Others, like you, who is reading this README file, can help tracking if there is any logic fragile (debug).
3. ~~Get familiar with GitHub~~
4. ~~Don't you think it is really cool to type on GitHub?~~
